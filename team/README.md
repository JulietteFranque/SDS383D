### Goals of peer review

Your primary obligation is to be helpful to your reviewee.  Focus on constructive criticism; deficits in code or derivations are opportunities to improve.  

Here are some ways you might consider helping out:  
0) Helping with overall coding style.  [Hadley Wickham](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html) has a nice R style guide.  The important thing is not that you ape any one person's coding style, but that you adopt _some_ consistent style (i.e. set of conventions about you write code).  
1) Pointing out where code could be made more readable, whether that involves restructuring, commenting better, using more informative variable names, proposing a cleaner directory structure, etc.  
2) Suggesting specific efficiency or stability improvements in code.  
3) Profiling someone's code to see where the bottlenecks are.  
4) Rewriting someone's R function in Rcpp.  
5) Suggestions for where mathematical exposition could be improved.  
6) (More for later in the semester): substantive questions/critiques about someone's modeling choices.  
7) Run a prior/model/outlier sensitivity analysis on someone's model.  
8) etc.  This isn't an exhaustive list.  


There is no expectation that you spend hours on a peer review, or do anything close to all of these things in any one peer review.  Focus your efforts where you expect they will do the most good.  In the neighborhood of 1-2 hours is an appropriate amount of time -- maybe more or less, depending on interest and circumstance.  For example, if you're learning a lot from someone's code, you might find it a wise investment to spend more time with it.  In addition to helping out your buddy, you should be learning from this experience, as well.  A lot of great writers learned to write by reading and editing the work of others.  The same is true of coding.  


### Peer review 1: Due Monday Feb 20  

The pairings are:  Rohit/Chenfeng, Jesse/An Thanh, Ciara/Giorgio, Zhenpei/Jennifer, Spencer -> Yinan -> Diego -> Spencer (where -> indicates "reviews").  Please e-mail your peer reviews to your reviewee, CCing me, by Monday, February 20.  You can post your peer review on your GitHub site and send a link, or just send a PDF.
